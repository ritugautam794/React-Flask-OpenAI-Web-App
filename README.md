# fullstack-webapp-flask-react-openai
This project is a web application built with React.js on the frontend and Flask on the backend, utilizing the OpenAI API. The application converts hex color codes into their corresponding English color names and interprets the mood associated with the color. Users can input any hex code, and the application will return the color's name along with a mood description, providing a unique and creative way to understand colors beyond their visual appeal.

The project demonstrates the integration of AI-powered natural language processing with a modern web development stack, offering an intuitive and interactive user experience.
